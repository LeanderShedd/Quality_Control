#Learning R and RStudio
Before we start, we need to download R and RStudio.

Go to the link below and download and run the file.  
[Download R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)

```{r include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(here)
setwd(here())
```

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/Downloading_R.png")
```


[Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)


```{r echo = F}

include_graphics("Screenshots/Downloading_RStudio.png")


```

After you download and install the appropriate R and RStudio versions, open RStudio. It should look something like this. 

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/R_Session.png")
```

Click the button at the top left circled in the above screenshot and press New Script

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/New_script.png")
```

Let's look at each section

### Top Right

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/Environment.png")
```

The environment is where your data and objects are stored. If you create a variable, it will be shown here. 

### Bottom right. 

```{r}
include_graphics("Screenshots/files.png")
```

This section is a representation of your files in the same folder as the directory that you're in. More on this later, but this section is also where your plots are output, and where your packages are (read: other people's code that you're using)

### Top Left

```{r}
include_graphics("Screenshots/topleft.png")
```

This section is where you will write your R code in a script that you can save and document to look back at. Most of your work will be in this section.

### Bottom left 

```{r}
include_graphics("Screenshots/console.png")
```

The console runs R code directly. Type x = 5, press enter, and see what happens.

```{r}
include_graphics("Screenshots/x_equals_5.png")
```
```{r}
include_graphics("Screenshots/environment_xequals5.png")
```

As you can see, the code is run in the console, and the result is shown in the console.  

That's essentially how we use RStudio! Now let's go to Chapter 3 examples.

#Chapter 3 Examples

##Example 3.1: Health Insurance Claims

This example asks us to create a stem and leaf plot from the data given. Here's the R solution.

```{r}
#First create a dataframe and input the data
health_data = data.frame(Claim = c(1:40), Days = c(48,41,35,36,37,26,36,46,35,47, 35,34,36,42,43,36,56,32,46,30,37,43,17,26,28,27,45,33,22,27,16,22,33,30,24,23,22,30,31,17))

#make the stem and leaf plot
#if you want to know more about the stem function, run ?stem in the console
#the $ character specifies the column
stem(health_data$Days)
```


##Example 3.2:Metal Thickness in Silicon Wafers

This example is actually all about histograms. The histogram function is very easy to use in R, but getting the data can be a pain. Feel free to copy the data entry part if it makes your life easier. Here's the implementation.
```{r}
wafer_thickness = data.frame(Thickness = c(438,413,444,468,445,472,474,454,455,449,450,450,450,459,466,470,457,441,450,445,487,430,446,450,456,433,455,459,423,455,451,437,444,453,434,454,448,435,432,441,452,465,466,473,471,464,478,446,459,464,441,444,458,454,437,443,465,435,444,457,444,471,471,458,459,449,462,460,445,437,461,453,452,438,445,435,454,428,454,434,432,431,455,447,454,435,425,449,449,452,471,458,445,463,423,451,440,442,441,439))

hist(wafer_thickness$Thickness, breaks = 20)
#the number of breaks is relatively arbitrary, I chose 15 here because it most adequately illustrated the outliers and the variety in the data.
```


##Example 3.3: Defects in Automobile Hoods

This example is remarkably similar to the previous one. 
```{r}
#define the data
Surface_defects = data.frame(Num_defects = c(6,1, 5,7,8,6,0,2,4, 2,5,2, 4,4,1,4,1,7,2, 3,4,3, 3,3,6,3,2,3,4, 5,5,2, 3,4,4,4,2,3,5, 7,5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 3, 3, 3, 12))

#graph using a histogram
hist(Surface_defects$Num_defects, breaks = 10)

```


##Example 3.4: Hole Diameter

The focus of this example is using a box plot to visualize hold diameters in wings. Let's do it in R. 

```{r}
#get the data
Wing_data = data.frame(Hole_diameter = c(120.5, 120.4, 120.7,
120.9, 120.2, 121.1,
120.3, 120.1, 120.9,
121.3, 120.5, 120.8))

#boxplot
boxplot(Wing_data$Hole_diameter)

#this boxplot is not very pretty, but is great for visualizing data quickly and getting an idea about the outliers

```
