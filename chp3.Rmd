#Learning R and RStudio
Before we start, we need to download R and RStudio.

Go to the link below and download and run the file.  
[Download R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)

```{r include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(here)
setwd(here())
```

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/Downloading_R.png")
```


[Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)


```{r echo = F}

include_graphics("Screenshots/Downloading_RStudio.png")


```

After you download and install the appropriate R and RStudio versions, open RStudio. It should look something like this. (N.B. the author's personal RStudio console uses a dark theme, but the default background screen is white)

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/R_Session.png")
```

Click the button at the top left circled in the above screenshot and press New Script.

```{r}
include_graphics("Screenshots/R_script_button.png")
```


```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/New_script.png")
```

Let's look at each section

### Top Right
   ,
```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/Environment.png")
```

The environment is where your data and objects are stored. If you create a variable, it will be shown here.  
At the end of this tutorial, your environment will be full of variables and objects, like the environment shown below.    
```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/full_environment.png")
```

  

### Bottom right. 

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/files.png")
```

This section is a representation of your files in the same folder as the directory that you're in. More on this later, but this section is also where your plots are output, and where your packages are (read: other people's code that you're using)

### Top Left

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/topleft.png")
```

This section is where you will write your R code in a script that you can save and document to look back at. Most of your work will be in this section.

### Bottom left 

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/console.png")
```

The console runs R code directly. Type x = 5, press enter, and see what happens.

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/x_equals_5.png")
```
```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/environment_xequals5.png")
```

As you can see, the code is run in the console, and the result is shown in the console.  

That's essentially how we use RStudio! Now let's go to Chapter 3 examples.

#Chapter 3 Examples  

##Example 3.1: Health Insurance Claims

This example asks us to create a stem and leaf plot from the data given. Here's the R solution.

```{r}
#First create a dataframe and input the data
health_data = data.frame(Claim = c(1:40), Days = c(48,41,35,36,37,26,36,46,35,47, 35,34,36,42,43,36,56,32,46,30,37,43,17,26,28,27,45,33,22,27,16,22,33,30,24,23,22,30,31,17))

#make the stem and leaf plot
#if you want to know more about the stem function, run ?stem in the console
#the $ character specifies the column
stem(health_data$Days)
```

For the first example, a screenshot of the result is included to illustrate how the code should look in your console/script after finishing the example. The rest will not include a screenshot, but the TA will be happy to accomodate if necessary. 

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_3_1.png")
```


##Example 3.2:Metal Thickness in Silicon Wafers

This example is actually all about histograms. The histogram function is very easy to use in R, but getting the data can be a pain. Feel free to copy the data entry part if it makes your life easier. Here's the implementation.  

```{r}
wafer_thickness = data.frame(Thickness = c(438,413,444,468,445,472,474,454,455,449,450,450,450,459,466,470,457,441,450,445,487,430,446,450,456,433,455,459,423,455,451,437,444,453,434,454,448,435,432,441,452,465,466,473,471,464,478,446,459,464,441,444,458,454,437,443,465,435,444,457,444,471,471,458,459,449,462,460,445,437,461,453,452,438,445,435,454,428,454,434,432,431,455,447,454,435,425,449,449,452,471,458,445,463,423,451,440,442,441,439))

hist(wafer_thickness$Thickness, breaks = 20)
#the number of breaks is relatively arbitrary, I chose 15 here because it most adequately illustrated the outliers and the variety in the data.
```


##Example 3.3: Defects in Automobile Hoods

This example is remarkably similar to the previous one. 
```{r}
#define the data
Surface_defects = data.frame(Num_defects = c(6,1, 5,7,8,6,0,2,4, 2,5,2, 4,4,1,4,1,7,2, 3,4,3, 3,3,6,3,2,3,4, 5,5,2, 3,4,4,4,2,3,5, 7,5, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 3, 3, 3, 12))

#graph using a histogram
hist(Surface_defects$Num_defects, breaks = 10)

```


##Example 3.4: Hole Diameter

The focus of this example is using a box plot to visualize hold diameters in wings. Let's do it in R. 

```{r}
#get the data
Wing_data = data.frame(Hole_diameter = c(120.5, 120.4, 120.7,
120.9, 120.2, 121.1,
120.3, 120.1, 120.9,
121.3, 120.5, 120.8))

#boxplot
boxplot(Wing_data$Hole_diameter)

#this boxplot is not very pretty, but is great for visualizing data quickly and getting an idea about the outliers

```


##Example 3.5: A Discrete Distribution

For finding the probability of one or fewer noncomforming parts in the sample we use the dbinom function. Here's how in R. 

```{r}
#add the probability of having 1 error to the probability of having two errors
probability = dbinom(0,size = 25, prob = .01) + dbinom(1,size = 25, prob = .01)
print(probability)

```

The probability of having 1 or fewer errors in a sample of 25 is about 97%, which is pretty great! There is an easier way of doing this in R, using a cumulative distribution function for the binomial distribution. 

```{r}
pbinom(1, size=25, prob=0.01)
```

That method is much faster, and is generally preferred. 

##Example 3.6: A continuous distribution

The example focuses on uniform/continuous distributions, which involves integration instead of summing multiple possibilities. Here's the corresponding R code. 

```{r}
#The uniform distribution is rather simple to work with, because the probability is simply the fraction of the space occupied by the area desired (in our case, less than or equal to 16)

probability = (16-15.5) / (17-15.5)
probability

```


##Example 3.7: Tensile Strength of Paper

The normal distribution is the focus of this example, with it asking us to find the probability that bags produced from this paper will meet or exceed the specification of greater than or equal to 35 tensile strength given a mean and sd. 

```{r}
#find the one tailed distribution
pnorm((35-40)/2, lower.tail = F)

```

The desired probability is 99.38%

##Example 3.8: Shaft Diameters

This is a two tailed normal distribution problem that is slightly harder than the previous example. 

```{r}

limit_1 = ( .2515-.25 ) / .0005
limit_2 = ( .2485 - .25) / .0005

(1-pnorm(limit_1,lower.tail = F)) - (1-pnorm(limit_2, lower.tail = F))

```

##Example 3.9: Another Use of the Standard Normal Table

Because we're in R, we have no use for looking values up in tables, but this problem is about using the normal tables backwards. We use the percent to get a value given a distribution.

```{r}
#in R, we use the qnorm function for this task
qnorm(.95, mean = 10, sd = 3)
```

##Example 3.10: Medical Laser Lifetime

For this example, we'll use the cumulative distribution function to find the probability the lifetime exceeds 500 hours. 

```{r}
plnorm(log(500), 6, 1.2, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

##Example 3.11: A Standby Redundant System

A standby redundant system operates in such a way that the components switch on and off at times modeled by a gamma distribution. We want to know the mean time to failure using the cumulative gamma distribution function. Here's the corresponding R code. 

```{r}
#In this case, we do not need to use the dgamma or the pgamma functions, but we simply need to estimate the mean time by dividing r by lambda. 

mean_time = 2 / (.0001)
mean_time
```


#Example 3.12: Time to Failure for Electronic Components

For our final example of the chapter, we move over to our last distribution: the Weibull distribution. We will use the mean time to failure equation as well as the fraction of components equation to answer this example. Here is the code in R. 


```{r}

mean_time = 5000 * gamma(1+ 1/(1/2))
mean_time

Fraction_survive = 1- exp(-(20000/5000)^.5)
Fraction_survive

```

The mean time to failure is 10000 hours, and the fraction of subassemblies that will survive is a little over 86%.
