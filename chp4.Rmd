This walkthrough will go over each of the example exercises in chapter 4, covering Inferences about Process Quality.


## Example 4.1: Computer Response Time

This example teaches us about basic hypothesis testing and One-Sample Z tests specific to the question "is the mean response time to a specific type of command greater than 75 ms". We're given the mean of a random sample (called x_bar), the hypothesis mean (called mu), the standard deviation (called sd), and the size of the sample (called n). 

Here's how to do it in R.



```{r}
#first define the variables
x_bar = 79.25
sample_mu = 75
sd = 8
n = 25

#now find the Z score

Z = (x_bar - sample_mu) / (sd / sqrt(n))
p = 1 - pnorm(Z)

print(paste("The Z score of the example is ", Z, ", and the p score associated is ", p, sep = ""))


```
