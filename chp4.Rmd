This walkthrough will go over each of the example exercises in chapter 4, covering Inferences about Process Quality.




## Example 4.1: Computer Response Time

This example teaches us about basic hypothesis testing and One-Sample Z tests specific to the question "is the mean response time to a specific type of command greater than 75 ms". We're given the mean of a random sample (called x_bar), the hypothesis mean (called mu), the standard deviation (called sd), and the size of the sample (called n). 

Here's how to do it in R.



```{r}
#first define the variables
x_bar = 79.25
sample_mu = 75
sd = 8
n = 25

#now find the Z score

Z = (x_bar - sample_mu) / (sd / sqrt(n))
p = 1 - pnorm(Z)

print(paste("The Z score of the example is ", Z, ", and the p score associated is ", p, sep = ""))


```

Because we specified a type 1 error of a = .05 and the test is one sided, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean response time exceeds 75ms. 

```{r}

```



## Example 4.2: Computer Response Time pt 2


This example introduces two-sided confidence intervals to what we already know about hypothesis testing using a similar example to 4.1. The following R code explains how to compute this given x_bar, Z, sigma, and n.


```{r}
#first define variables
x_bar = 79.25
Z = 1.96
sigma = 8
n = 25

#Lower bound
lower_bound = x_bar - (Z) * (sigma / sqrt(n))

#Upper bound
upper_bound = x_bar + (Z) * (sigma / sqrt(n))

#Result
print(paste(lower_bound, "< mu <", upper_bound))

```

```{r}
#After running the code above, your screen should look like the output below

include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_4_2.png")
```

## Example 4.3: Rubberized Asphalt


This example asks us to interpret a dataset to find the sample standard deviation and sample mean, and use the test statistic for a fixed significance level. Now for the R!

```{r}
#given variables
null_hypothesis = 3200
dataset_rubberized = data.frame(Specimen = c(1:15), Stabilized_Viscosity = c(3193, 3124, 3153, 3145, 3093, 3466, 3355, 2979, 3182, 3227, 3256, 3332, 3204, 3282, 3170))

#mean and standard deviation
visc_mean = mean(dataset_rubberized$Stabilized_Viscosity)

visc_sd = sd(dataset_rubberized$Stabilized_Viscosity)

#t statistic
t_stat = (visc_mean - null_hypothesis) / (visc_sd / sqrt(nrow(dataset_rubberized)))

#Range
qt(c(.025, .975), df = 14)
