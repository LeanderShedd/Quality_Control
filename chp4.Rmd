This walkthrough will go over each of the example exercises in chapter 4, covering Inferences about Process Quality.




## Example 4.1: Computer Response Time

This example teaches us about basic hypothesis testing and One-Sample Z tests specific to the question "is the mean response time to a specific type of command greater than 75 ms". We're given the mean of a random sample (called x_bar), the hypothesis mean (called mu), the standard deviation (called sd), and the size of the sample (called n). 

Here's how to do it in R.



```{r}
#first define the variables
x_bar = 79.25
sample_mu = 75
sd = 8
n = 25

#now find the Z score

Z = (x_bar - sample_mu) / (sd / sqrt(n))
p = 1 - pnorm(Z)

print(paste("The Z score of the example is ", Z, ", and the p score associated is ", p, sep = ""))


```

Because we specified a type 1 error of a = .05 and the test is one sided, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean response time exceeds 75ms. 

```{r}

#After running the code above, your screen should look like the output below

```



## Example 4.2: Computer Response Time pt 2


This example introduces two-sided confidence intervals to what we already know about hypothesis testing using a similar example to 4.1. The following R code explains how to compute this given x_bar, Z, sigma, and n.


```{r}
#first define variables
x_bar = 79.25
Z = 1.96
sigma = 8
n = 25

#Lower bound
lower_bound = x_bar - (Z) * (sigma / sqrt(n))

#Upper bound
upper_bound = x_bar + (Z) * (sigma / sqrt(n))

#Result
print(paste(lower_bound, "< mu <", upper_bound))

```

```{r}
#After running the code above, your screen should look like the output below

include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_4_2.png")
```

## Example 4.3: Rubberized Asphalt


This example asks us to interpret a dataset to find the sample standard deviation and sample mean, and use the test statistic for a fixed significance level. Now for the R!

```{r}
#given variables
null_hypothesis = 3200
dataset_rubberized = data.frame(Specimen = c(1:15), Stabilized_Viscosity = c(3193, 3124, 3153, 3145, 3093, 3466, 3355, 2979, 3182, 3227, 3256, 3332, 3204, 3282, 3170))

#mean and standard deviation
visc_mean = mean(dataset_rubberized$Stabilized_Viscosity)

visc_sd = sd(dataset_rubberized$Stabilized_Viscosity)

#t statistic
t_stat = (visc_mean - null_hypothesis) / (visc_sd / sqrt(nrow(dataset_rubberized)))

#Range
Range_t <- qt(c(.025, .975), df = 14)
if(Range_t[1] < t_stat & t_stat < Range_t[2]){
  print(TRUE)
}
print(paste(round(Range_t[1],3), "<", round(t_stat, 3), "<", round(Range_t[2], 3)))


```

After completion, your screen should look something like this

```{r}

include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_4_3.png")
```


## Example 4.4: Rubberized Viscosity pt 2

Working off of the previous example, 4.4 asks us to find the 95% confidence interval on the mean stabilized viscosity given equation 4.36. The implementation in R is as follows.

```{r}
#given variables
null_hypothesis = 3200
dataset_rubberized = data.frame(Specimen = c(1:15), Stabilized_Viscosity = c(3193, 3124, 3153, 3145, 3093, 3466, 3355, 2979, 3182, 3227, 3256, 3332, 3204, 3282, 3170))

#mean and standard deviation
visc_mean = mean(dataset_rubberized$Stabilized_Viscosity)

visc_sd = sd(dataset_rubberized$Stabilized_Viscosity)

#t statistic
t_stat = (visc_mean - null_hypothesis) / (visc_sd / sqrt(nrow(dataset_rubberized)))

#Range
Range_t <- qt(c(.025, .975), df = 14)

#Lower bound
lower_bound = visc_mean - Range_t[2] * (visc_sd / sqrt(15))

#Upper bound
upper_bound = visc_mean + Range_t[2] * (visc_sd / sqrt(15))

#Finished interval
print(paste(round(lower_bound,3), "< mean stabilized viscosity <", round(upper_bound, 3)))


```

```{r}
include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_4_4.png")
```


## Example 4.5: A Forging Process

This example is similar to example 4.4, but the hypothesis is a p value instead of a mean, using the inference on a population proportion's formula (equation 4.43)  Here we go!

```{r}
#given variables
errors = 41
sample_size = 250
null_hypothesis = .1

#Equation
Z = ((errors - .5) - sample_size * null_hypothesis) / sqrt(sample_size * null_hypothesis * (1 - null_hypothesis))

if(Z > 1.96) {
  print("REJECT")
}
if(Z < 1.96){
  print("ACCEPT")
}

```

```{r}
include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_4_5.png")
```

## Example 4.6: Mortgage Applications

Given a fraction of acceptable samples and a desired percent confidence, can we find a confidence interval? Here's how using equation 4.44

```{r}
#Given variables
total_samples = 80
rejected_applications = 15
fraction_rejected = rejected_applications / total_samples
Z_score = 1.96

#Lower Bound
lower_bound = fraction_rejected - Z_score * sqrt((fraction_rejected * (1 - fraction_rejected)) / total_samples)

#Upper Bound
upper_bound = fraction_rejected + Z_score * sqrt((fraction_rejected * (1 - fraction_rejected)) / total_samples)

print(paste(round(lower_bound,4), "< p <", round(upper_bound, 4)))


```

```{r}
include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_4_6.png")

```

## Example 4.7: Finding the Power of a Test

```{r}
#install.packages("asbio")


```

```{r}
#currently can't figure this out, it is throwing me a bunch of errors and the wrong answer, will revisit later
#library(asbio)

#power = power.z.test(sigma = .1, effect = 1, n = 9, test = "one.tail")

#print(power)

```


## Example 4.8: Comparing Paint Formulations

This example focuses on two samples and creating/testing  hypotheses specific to them. We're given the means of both samples, and need to test whether or not there is a significant difference from the two. Here is the implementation of equation 4.48 in R:


```{r}
#Given variables
x_1 = 121
x_2 = 112
sample_1 = 10
sample_2 = 10
sd = 8

#The Null Hypothesis is that the mean drying time for paints is the same

#Z Score calculation
Z = (x_1 - x_2) / sqrt( ( (sd^2) / sample_1 ) + ( ( sd^2) / sample_2 ) )

if(Z > 1.645){
  print("Reject Null Hypothesis")
}
if(Z < 1.645){
  print("Accept Null Hypothesis")
}

```


```{r}
include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_4_8.png")
```

## Example 4.9 Comparing Mean Yields

Given a dataset of two populations and 8 observations each, let's use a t test to figure out which catalyst should be adopted. The example specifies that catalyst 2 is cheaper and should be used if there is no difference between the two. 

```{r}

#Generate data frame
Catalyst_data = data.frame(Observation_num = c(1:8), Catalyst_1 = c(91.50, 94.18, 92.18, 95.39, 91.79, 89.07, 94.72, 89.21), Catalyst_2 = c(89.19, 90.95, 90.46, 93.21, 97.19, 97.04, 91.07, 92.75))

#Evaluate data frame
x_1 = mean(Catalyst_data$Catalyst_1)
x_2 = mean(Catalyst_data$Catalyst_2)
sd_1 = sd(Catalyst_data$Catalyst_1)
sd_2 = sd(Catalyst_data$Catalyst_2)
n = 8

#Calculate Pooled estimator of sigma^2 from eq 4.51
s_pooled = sqrt(((n -1) * (sd_1 ^ 2) + (n - 1) * (sd_2 ^ 2)) /  ( n + n - 2))

#Now calculate t statistic
t_stat = (x_1 - x_2) / (s_pooled * sqrt((1/n) + (1/n)))

#Find acceptable range for t value
Range_t <- qt(c(.025, .975), df = 14)

if(Range_t[1] < t_stat & Range_t[2] > t_stat) {
  print("Accept null hypothesis")
} else{
  print("Reject null hypothesis")
}


```

```{r}
#Here's what an R console would look like
include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_4_9.png")
```


## Example 4.10: Doped Versus Undoped Cement

The crux of this example is the two samples t test with two different sample sizes. Given the means, standard deviation, and sample size of both samples, we need to use the t test to determine if there is an affect, in this case, of doping cement. 

```{r}
#Given variables
x_1 = 90
x_2 = 87
sd_1 = 5
sd_2 = 4
n_1 = 10
n_2 = 15

#Application of equation 4.57
s_pooled = sqrt((((n_1 - 1) * (sd_1 ^ 2)) + ((n_2 - 1) * (sd_2 ^ 2))) / (n_1 + n_2 - 2))

t_value <- qt(c(.025, .975), df = 23)[2]

#Left bound
left_bound = x_1 - x_2 - t_value * s_pooled * sqrt((1/n_1) + (1/n_2))
#Now for the right
right_bound = x_1 - x_2 + t_value * s_pooled * sqrt((1/n_1) + (1/n_2))

#Let's bring it all together
Mean_diff = x_1 - x_2

if(left_bound < Mean_diff & Mean_diff < right_bound) {
  print("Cannot Reject Null Hypothesis")
} else{
  print("Reject Null Hypothesis")
}



```

```{r}
#Here's what an R console would look like
include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_4_9.png")
```
