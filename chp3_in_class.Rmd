##Example 1: Time to Failure

Electronic Components are subjected to an accelerated life test. A sample of failure times is given below.

```{r echo = F}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_3_1_in_class.png")
```

1. What is the average and standard deviation of the failure times?  
2. Construct a histogram of the data. Add a title and change the number of bins.  
3. Create a stem-and-leaf plot of the data.  

  
##Example 2: Viscosity

Data on the viscosity of liquid substances is given in the table below. Construct a probability plot of the data. What can be interpreted from the graph?

```{r echo = F}
include_graphics("Screenshots/Example_3_2_in_class.png")
```

##Example 3: Tensile strength
  
The tensile strength of a metal part is normally distributed with mean 600 lb and standard deviation 50 lb.
If 50,000 parts are produced, how many would you expect to fail to meet a minimum specification limit of 550 lb tensile strength?  
What about if the specification was 450?
