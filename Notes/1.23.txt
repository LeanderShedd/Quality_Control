part of chapter 4 to be completed

4.1 
4.2 try to use confint using Z dist
4.3 t distribtuion, has a probability plot go ahead and use that
4.4 confint with t dist
4.3.4 included sub example
4.5 + 4.6 + 4.7

for examples in class:
single sample: inference on mu for variance known and variance unknown and their confidence intervals
inference on variance example
inference on population proportion and confint

to do:
create tutorial send out tonight
send chapter 3 and in class solution
pick out chapter 4 exercise: email that document
add code for larger dataframes and include that in examples
