Notes: couldn't find 4.20 4.27 examples
added 4.13 because 4.15 depended on it, and we needed to introduce how to do linear regression also introduced the concept of making a function in R and helped explain how to do it

to do:
remove 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 4.15 (for now)
add 4.12
add back of the book solutions
4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, 4.15, 4.20. 4.27
